# Tail-finding

A set of codes which help people measure tail angles of ram pressure stripping galaxies.

Several codes have been made, which all have the same main functions, but call different kinds of images
draw_tails_decals_RGB.py takes user supplied RA and Dec coordinates, and displays the legacy survey cutout image to classify.
draw_tails_decals_RGB_w_example.py contains the function along with an example method of calculating tail angles.
